If a [[Semiotics|sign]] is used to mean a specific thing for a long time and by enough people, that meaning solidifies into a Myth. Eg. The sign 'red' has a meaning: danger. That is a myth.

> Myths:  
> The association or Culturally constructed meaning or values - attached to everyday objects, practices, and symbols. These meaning often reinforce dominant ideologies within a society.

Myth, in this context, is a system of communication - it is a  message. It does not try to deny reality - but it has a function of justifying/ purifying it. When studying a myth, ask who does this myth benefit. Its generally the people in power.

This is what Branding does.

This definition comes from the work of Roland Barthes. He studied the Semiotics of Culture.
