Schema is the mental structure of ideas. We use this framework to represent an understanding of the world - and to organize and assimilate new information we get.

Assimilation is the process of integrating a new idea into an existing system of beliefs without the need for much change.

Accommodation is when a child encounters new information that does not fit within their current schema. It requires some modification of their schema to fit in the new data. Another option is to create a new schema for this new information. These processes are called Accommodation.

When encoding to long term memory, anything that does not fit our existing schema will be thought of as irrelevant, and omitted/ forgotten. Each time the you recall a memory, it can shift to better fit your existing schema.

This concept is created by Jean Piaget in his work on [[Stages of Cognitive Development in Children]].

Schema's about oneself is called the [[Self-Schema]].
