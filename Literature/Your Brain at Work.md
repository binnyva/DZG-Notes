- Prioritize Prioritizing
- Brain as a stage - with the 'director' controlling who comes on stage at what time
- New concepts take up more energy to hold in your mind in active focus compared to concepts you already know
- Brain wants to load the easiest concepts into working memory. Practice loading the most important concepts instead.
- There is an energy cost to stop your brain from engaging with distractions. This is the braking  cost.
- Good Stress - an optimal amount of stress is required for peak performance
- Practice intentionally increasing and decreasing neuro-transmitters(oxytocin, dopamine, adrenaline, etc).
- Impasse: Getting stuck with the same solutions. You can get out of this by letting the brain go idle.
- Insights happen more when you are relaxed and happy.
- Two Responses to Stimuli
	- Away Response - Minimize Danger
	- Toward Response - Maximize Reward
- Expectations
	- Met Expectations create a slight increase in dopamine / slight reward
	- Exceeded expectation create a strong increase
	- Unmet expectations create a large decrease / strong threat response
