Logical Atomism...

- Simple facts are representable by simple logical propositions
- Language forms a picture of the world through logical connections

This can only come thru science empiricism - not thru ethics, religion, aesthetics, etc.

Words with no objective representation and unanalyzable by logic is nonsense/ pseudopropositons, and should be avoided. Philosophy has too much of this

Language is a social phenomenon

Philosophical problems are issues of misunderstanding -using different words to mean similar things
