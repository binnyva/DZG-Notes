We see others as 'Intentional agents' - and that is a major advantage our specie has: it enables us to corporate better with others.

What do we mean by 'Intentional Agents'...

- Others have goals
- Others perceive things
- Their actions are driven by these

As a group, shared intention means...

- Shared Goals
- Shared Attention
- Joint Goal -> Joint Attention -> Joint Plan/Intentions

This can be explained by evolutionary psychology.

We have biological programming to conform to the group. We not only want to conform, we want to enforce the conformation to others as well.
