Field of study created by Alfred Korzybsky(famous for [[Map is not the Territory]])

> General Semantics is the study of how we perceive, construct, evaluate and respond to our life experiences. Our language - behaviors represent one aspect of these responses.
  
Time-binding: The ability to transfer knowledge to the next generation. Building up on the knowledge of previous generations. This is done through symbols and abstractions made possible by language. 

We are able to create a map of reality using these abstractions. But its important to understand that Map is not Territory.
