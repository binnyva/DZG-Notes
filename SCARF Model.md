SCARF stands for the five key "domains" that influence our behavior in social situations...

1. **Status**
2. **Certainty**
3. **Autonomy**
4. **Relatedness** - how safe we feel with others.
5. **Fairness**

To help people feel more safer, you can try changing the threats and rewards in these five areas.

To make an activity more appealing, you can think how to tweak the activity to reward one or more of the elements in this list.
