According to Bell Hooks in her book 'All About Love'

Love is a combination of care, knowledge, responsibility, commitment and trust.

She also uses this definition from Scott Peck(Book: Road Less Travelled)...

Love is the will to nurture one's own or another's spiritual growth.

> When we see love as the will to nurture one's own or another's spiritual growth, revealed through acts of care, respect, knowing, and assuming responsibility, the foundation of all love in our life is the same. There is no special love exclusively reserved for romantic partners. Genuine love is the foundation of our engagement with ourselves, with family, with friends, with partners, with everyone we choose to love.
