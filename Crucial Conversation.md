A conversation is crucial if it has...

- Opposing opinions
- High stakes
- Strong emotions

There is an inaccurate choice during crucial conversations, which is choosing between telling the truth and keeping a friend. There is a way to do both.

Once you recognize the need for conversation, get to it fast. Avoid [[Conflict Lag]].

### Topic of Conversation

- Content: The immediate pain
- Pattern: if the same issue has happened three or more times its a pattern
- Relationship: If the problems continue, it can impact the relationship. This can affect trust, belief of competence or respect towards the other person.
- Process: If all things are going well and you still have an issue, you might need to talk about the process of the conversation.

### During the conversation

What is the bigger picture? What is the goal of this conversation? Keep that in mind when going into the conversation.

### Ensure safety

Spot the turning point - when the conversation turns crucial. Watch for problem responses - [[Silence or Violence]].

###  How are you reacting - control your emotions

Retracing your path to action(Think [[ABC of CBT]])

- Act: Examine your behavior
- Feel: What are you feeling?
- Story: What is my belief about my observations / what is the story I'm telling myself
- See / hear: The observable facts

Share your story - encourage others to share theirs

- Test your story and others story
- If they don't share, use the priming technique: [[Guessing Other's Emotional State]]

### Make content safe

- Mention the common purpose
- Keep mutual respect

### Watch for topic changes

If the other party brings up a different topic(for eg. a past incident, another concern, etc.), acknowledge it. You can bookmark the topic for another conversation if need be - but stay on topic.

### Move to result

- Assign actionables: who does what
- Follow through: When and who follows up
- Document these things
