Stages of Cognitive Development / Developmental Psychology...

### Sensory-motor: 0-2 Years

- Tries to understand the world thru their senses
- Understanding that they are different from the world around them
- Object Permanence
- Trail and error to get attention from care givers

### Pre-operational: 2-7 Years

- Emergence of Language
- Use of words and pictures to represent object
- Sees primarily from only their point of view/ Egocentric

### Concrete Operational: 7-11 Years

- Development of Logical Reasoning
- Socio-centric / observe other people view points as well and can understand the difference to their view point

### Formal operational: 12+ Years

- Abstract Thought and hypothetical thinking
- Thinking thru consequences
- Problem solving without trial and error
- Can do mental operation without physical assists

## Later updates to this theory

- Children can go thru this stages at varying time scales
- External factors have a influence on development(eg. socio-economic status)
