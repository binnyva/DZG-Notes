Dreyfus model is used to access and support skill development. It can also provide an acceptable level for measuring competence or capability.

It has 5 levels...

- **Novice**: Low level of understanding. Need supervision. 
- **Advanced Beginner**: Working understanding. Sees tasks as a series of steps. Can complete simple tasks without supervision.
- **Competent**: Good working and background understanding. Sees actions in context. Can complete tasks independently - but might lack polish.
- **Proficient**: Deep understanding. Sees actions holistically. High standard results.
- **Expert**: Authoritative or deep holistic understanding. Routine tasks are intuitive. Goes beyond existing interpretations.

<table>
<tr><th>Stage</th><th>Characteristics</th><th>Knowledge</th><th>Context Assessment</th><th>Decision Making</th></tr>
<tr>
<td>Novice</td>
<td>Follows taught rules or plans strictly. 
No discretionary judgement.</td>
<td>No reference to context</td>
<td>Analytically</td>
<td>Rational</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Advanced Beginner</td>
<td>Has a categorization of actions in mind, and follows steps based on internal categorization of the specific action
All categories are treated separately and given equal importance.
</td>
<td>In Context</td>
<td>Analytically</td>
<td>Rational</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Competent</td>
<td>Sees actions in terms of longer term goals(at least partially)
Conscious, deliberate planning
Standardized procedures</td>
<td>In Context</td>
<td>Analytically</td>
<td>Rational</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Proficient</td>
<td>Views situations holistically rather than as categories
Prioritizes actions based on situation
Understands deviations from normal pattern
Easier decision making</td>
<td>In Context</td>
<td>Holistically</td>
<td>Rational</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Expert</td>
<td>No longer needs rules, maxims
Intuitive grasp of situation based on deep Understanding
Analytic approaches used in novel situations or when problems arise.</td>

|------------|---------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------|
| Novice     | Little or textbook knowledge. No practical know-how     | Unsatisfactory unless supervised               | Needs close supervision or instruction                            | Can't handle complexity                                                              | Sees actions in isolation                              |
| Beginner   | Working knowledge of key aspects of practice            | Easier tasks are satisfactory                  | Can do some actions independently, but overall, needs supervision | Understands complex situations, asks for support appropriately                       | Sees actions as series of steps                        |
| Competent  | Good working and background knowledge in area           | Fit for purpose, but not refined               | Can complete most tasks independently                             | Can cope with complex situations with analysis and planning                          | Sees actions in terms of longer term goals             |
| Proficient | In depth understanding of area                          | Produces acceptable solutions most of the time | Fully independent                                                 | Deals with complex situations holistically. Confident decision making                | Sees the overall picture and how actions fit within it |
| Expert     | Authoritative knowledge and tacit understanding of area | Excellence achieved with ease                  | Goes beyond existing standards                                    | Holistic grasp of complexity. Can change between intuitive and analytical approaches | Sees overall picture and alternative approaches        |
