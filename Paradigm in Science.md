> (Paradigm) provides a map whose details are elucidated by nature scientific research. And since nature is too complex and varied to be explored a random, that map is as essential as observation and experimentation to science's continuing development. thought the theories they embody, paradigms prove to be constitutive of the research activity  
> Thomas Kuhn, Book: The Structure of Scientific Revolutions

Science has two stages of development...

### Normal Science

> 'Normal Science' means research firmly based upon one or more past scientific achievements, achievements that some particular scientific community acknowledges for a time as supplying the foundation for its further practice.  
> Kuhn  

When someone notices a unexpected result, they try to fit it into the existing knowledge some way. Maybe by tweaking the current theories. There will be cases of dismissing/suppressing the unexpected result as well.

People in 'Normal Science' mode will not look for new theories/ new phenomena. They accept theories on the authority of the teacher and the text, not because of evidence.

### Extra-ordinary/ Revolutionary

If the results still do not fit, people will start proposing new theories - that are fundamentally different from the existing systems.

Stages: Pre-Science -> Normal Science -> Model Drift -> Model Crisis -> Modal Revolution -> Paradigm Shift -> (new) Normal Science

### Paradigm Shift

This is the conversion from one mode to the other. The choice has to be made almost as a leap of faith - because you cannot use the tools and ideas of one paradigm to judge the other.

> He must have faith that the new paradigm will succeed with the many large problem that confront it, knowing only that the older paradigm has failed with a few. A decision of that kind can only be made on faith.
