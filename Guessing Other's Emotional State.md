This is a conversation technique where you guess another person's emotional state and story they are telling themselves. You communicate it to them - as a guess on our side. 

"It seems like you are upset about this. Would it be because you felt unheard?"

They'll confirm or share their actual state.

This is very useful if you notice any safety risk during a [[Crucial Conversation]].
