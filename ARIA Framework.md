ARIA is used to get to insights faster. You can use this when you face a problem that requires an insight to move further. ARIA stands for...

- Awareness: Look inside yourself to see how you are feeling, where does your mind lead you to.

- Insight: Once you put enough time and energy into this, you should gain an insight
- Action: Act on the insight you found.
