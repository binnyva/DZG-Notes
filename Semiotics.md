Semiotics is the study of signs - or how words and images(signs) come to have meaning.

Components of Semiotics...

- Sign/Signifier: The word/ image. Eg. Apple Logo
- Denotation: The Literal Meaning. Eg. Logo of the Apple Company
- Connotation: The Assigned Meaning. Expensive electronics, Well Designed, Over-priced, etc.

Signs are Polysemic - it can be read in multiple different ways. Eg. Red can mean danger, blood, stop, etc.

If signs are used for a specific connotation for a long time, it becomes a [[Myth in Semiotics|myth]]. The process of a sign becoming a myth is called naturalization.
