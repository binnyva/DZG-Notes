> The process by which people continuously create, through their actions and interactions, a shared reality that is experienced as objectively factual and subjectively meaningful.  

The main sociological question in this is 'How does something come to be accepted as real?'. This process has 3 parts...

## Externalization

First step to create a social reality - we project our ideas and meanings onto the world. Eg. People coming together to create a law.

- Nature("given" to humans)
- Culture(made by humans)
	- Material Culture - hardware we make
	- Non-material Culture - Ideas, norms, values

- Nature
	- Natural facts(mountains, lions)
- Culture
	- Technological facts(eg. Hammers, Computers)
	- Institutional Facts(eg. money, marriage)
	- Normative facts(eg. Freedom, fulfillment)

## Objectivation

Process by which given meanings becomes seen as objective reality. This can happen in these ways...

- Institutionalization: When meaningful behaviors become habitual/routine
- Historicity: More time we have with a meaning, the more it 'hardens'.
- Legitimization: Given a cognitive and moral basis that will explain/justify it. Eg. Religion
- Language: Meaning becomes embedded in language

##  Internalization

This is the process where an individual absorbs the social reality in themselves.
