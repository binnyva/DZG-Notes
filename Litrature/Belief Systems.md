Belief systems are stories we tell ourselves to "make sense" of the world. Eg. Early humans didn't know what thunder was. So they made a story that said thunder happens when the gods are angry. Suddenly an un-explained phenomena makes sense. There is meaning in it.

These are created and reinforced by culture, society, theology, experience and training. It can be anything - cultural values, stereotypes, political viewpoints, etc.

> A belief system need have no basis in reality so long as it consistently provides adequate explanations.

## Characteristics of Belief Systems

- Personal commitment. Believers are committed to it - this is the source of the strength of the Belief System.
- Belief systems are bigger than the believers. It lives longer than lives of individual believers.
- The boundaries of a belief system soft and ill-defined. In can change among believers and over time.
- The elements (concepts, propositions, rules, etc.) of belief systems. This is not a universal set - different Belief systems have different elements. It can vary in complexity as well.
- Existence or nonexistence of certain conceptual entities are explained. Eg. God, motherland, etc.
- Alternative worlds - Belief systems have an map/representation of how the world should be(or should not be).
- Belief systems have a list of things that are categorized as 'good' or 'bad'(or leads to good/bad outcomes). The purpose is both cognitive(creates knowledge) and motivational(creates actions).
- Belief systems can have many "stories" from personal experience, folklore(for religions), propaganda(for political ideas), etc.
- There can be varying levels of belief. People don't have to be 100% certain. The confidence can change with new information.

## Elements of Belief Systems

- **Values**: Belief systems define what is good or valuable.
- **Substantive beliefs**: They foundational(and more important) beliefs of a belief system. Eg. God Exists.
- **Orientation**: Believers can think there is a well defined and commonly held belief about the system. But it may not actually exist in reality.
- **Language**: Logic that links Substantive beliefs to other beliefs within the system.
- **Perspective**: The believer's place in relation to other things, specially nature, social events or other social groups. Are we equals? Enemies? Rulers? Friends?
- **Prescriptions and proscriptions**: Rules and regulations. This might be tied to social reward and punishment.
- **Ideological Technology**: Set path ways/process to reach an ideal goal. This can have considerable influence over a believers life. This is not the core of the belief system - so it gets less commitment.
- **Symbols**: They emerge in conflicts of belief systems: they may be objects like writings, buildings, flags, etc. It symbolize the core of belief system.

## Some deductions

- Conflicts are not over Ideological Technology but over what symbolizes difference. 
- Substantive beliefs are understood only in terms of ideal values, criteria of validity, language and perspective. 
- A Believer can explain substantive beliefs more easily than values, criteria, logical principles or orientation.
- Ideal values, criteria of validity, language and perspective may have been built up around a substantive belief to give it significance and justification.
