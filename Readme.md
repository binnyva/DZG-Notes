I'm [Binny](https://binnyva.com/) and this is my digital garden. That means I publish the notes I make when learning things in this space. I use the Zettelkasten method to make these notes, so most notes will be small and interconnected to other notes. If you want to learn more about this system, check out my [book on Zettelkasten](https://mindos.in/zettelkasten-art-of-knowledge-management/)!

I use Obsidian to write the notes, and I have created a small tool called [11 Garden](https://github.com/binnyva/11-garden) that converts the markdown notes to static HTML.

If any of the topics I have a note on is of interest to you, please reach out to me on [twitter](https://twitter.com/binnyva) and say hi. I'm always happy to chat about any of these topics!

If you want to check out a note of something I'm currently(as of Sept 2024) studying about, check out [[Belief Systems]].
