Semantics in the study of meaning in language.

This is different from pragmatics as that is the study of meaning in the social context.

Eg. A asks B if he wants to hang out tonight. B says that he has a lot of work. In this example, the Semantic meaning is that B has a lot of work. But the Pragmatic meaning is that B cannot hang out. Even though B does not actually say that.
