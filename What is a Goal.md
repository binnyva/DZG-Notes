A goal is a recognizable, desired state in the future, that causes you to act differently in the present in order to realize it. 

A goal is a Recognizable(Recognizeable could be a concrete numerical target or just “I'll know it when I see it”. Without this, it's just a trajectory), desired(If it's not desired, then it's not your goal, it's something you think you *should* do. Towardsness goals also work way better than trying to *avoid* something.) state in the future.
