Using the knowledge and insights of one domain in another domain. This can create new insights, products, solutions or processes.

Use category of concepts when looking for different domains...

- Physical objects
- Natural phenomena
- Abstract concepts
- Mathematical concepts
- Scientific concepts
- Social concepts
- Historical Concepts
- Technological Concepts

A quick hack to understand concepts you don't understand. Try this using LLMs...

- "Explain _Domain 1_ using an analogy of _Domain 2_
- Look at D1 through the lens of D2
- Use D1 in the field of D2
- Example: How can I use systems thinking(D1) within the field of personal knowledge management(D2)

Be careful with using the LLM for this - it can give very convincing, but incorrect answers.
