There is a need for having a meta language that can describe meaning in any language. This is because of the problem of Circularity.

Lets say an alien visits earth and wants to learn our language. But we can provide a meaning for a word with more words. In Meta language, we can use a different system for this

This is used in [[Large Language Models]] - each word is represented by a vector - which is the meta language in this case.
