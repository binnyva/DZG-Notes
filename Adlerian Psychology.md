Alderian Psychology  or Individual Psychology is a contemporary school to Sigmund Freud's [[Psycho-Analytic Theory]].

## Objectives for life

- Be self reliant
	- Know that 'I have ability'
- Live in harmony with society
	- Know that people are my comrades and not my competition

Some concepts from this school...

## Life Tasks

- Tasks of work
- Tasks of friendship
- Tasks of Love
	- Love relationships
	- Family relationship

## Separation of Tasks

- Conflict comes when you intrude on other's tasks
- Task belong to the person who is most affected by the consequence of the decision
	- Eg. Studying is the child's task - no the parents
- You can help at others tasks -but not intrude. You can do this by being communicating a willingness to help - and only helping if they ask
- If you are looking for approval from others, you haven't separated your tasks

## Life Lie

- Reasons people have to avoid their life tasks.
- Eg. I can't write a book because I don't have any free time.

## Life Style

- This means Worldview/ Personality

## Community

- We are part of a community
- And make the community as big as possible - all of humanity, animals and even plants
- It's a 'unattainable ideal' - but a good goal to have
- When we have problems, zoom out to see more of the community - until you and cause of the problem become equals
	- Eg, you have a problem with your boss who has power over you at the work community level. But at the state community level, both of you are equal
- Goal of interpersonal relationship is "community feeling"
	- Sense of belonging, seeing others as comrades
	- Move from self interest to social interest. To do this, you need
		- Self acceptance
		- Confidence in others
		- Contribution to others
- Horizontal relations(everyone is equal) vs Vertical ones(hierarchy)
