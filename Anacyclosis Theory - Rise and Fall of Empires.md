Polybius, a greek historian living in Rome during the height of roman civilization created a theory on the cycle of rise and fall of empires called Anacyclosis.

- Stage 1: **Anarchy** - No Political Structure 
- Stage 2: **Monarchy** - a strong leader emerges bring in order
- Stage 3: **Tyranny** - the original king got the position by virtue. But later kings(usually descendants of the original) get it without the actual virtue - and thus be oppressive leaders.
- Stage 4: **Aristocracy** - the more powerful people in the tyrannical setting over throw the oppressive leader and take control.
- Stage 5: **Oligarchy** - Aristocracy becomes corrupted over time to this phase - when the rules try to enrich themselves.
- Stage 6: **Democracy** - The ordinary people rise up to take the power. Equality and freedom of speech becomes corner stones.
- Stage 7: **Mob Rule** - People get used to this and no longer defend the values - leading to rise of corrupt and deceitful leaders.

This can either devolve into Anarchy or a strong man leader emerges, restarting the cycle.
