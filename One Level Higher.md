One Level Higher is a [[Mental Model]] that tries to **go to a higher level of abstraction**. 

Ask yourself "Am I optimizing a cog or the entire machine?". Try to optimize the largest system you have access to rather than smaller components of the system.

> Is it higher-leverage to optimize a level above the one I'm focused on?
