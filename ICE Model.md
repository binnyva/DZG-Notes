When you have to prioritize, rate all options 1-10 for these questions...

1. **Impact** of success
2. **Confidence** of success
3. **Ease** of implementation(resource, time, etc)

Use the sum of the numbers to prioritize.

This is a [[Mental Model]] to make **short term**(weeks or months) decisions.
